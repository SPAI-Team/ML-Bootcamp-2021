Stumbled by this gem along the touristy boat quay from my sister-in-law's recommendations. It was difficult to find as the boat quay shophouses are not numbered, and the sign was a relatively small circle perpendicular to the side walk. An easy tip to find the place is by spotting the cat cafe right above it! The menu is simple and relatively small compared to its other outlet, but has the key elements of a Spanish restaurant - tapas, cured meats, alcohol and paella. We tried the cava sangria as i had not previously seen this anywhere else. Cava is the champagne of Spain, light and bubbly, usually to start off a meal. Sadly, although there was a good amount of fruits in the sangria, the overall taste of the sangria was rather bitter.. maybe from the cava or insufficient juice mixed in? We tried several tapas and the paella: the fried chorizo is a little salty, but still tasty. The olives had a good spicy kick to it. The melted cheese mushroom was good too. My personal favorite was the paella. It had good flavor, lots of seafood and chorizo but was a little salty for my taste. My favorite part of the little Spanish place is the view. The seats by the Singapore river were very breezy and has very good view of the city, including VCH, MBS, city hall, Fullerton. You also get live music from timbre across the river and some other bars further down the shophouses. It was also really nice that it wasn't particularly loud so conversation could be easily carried out.

Ignore the letter ‘S’\n","\n","2. Assign a number to the letters as follows: A=1, B=2, C=3, …etc. For the number plate SBA 1234, this is converted to 21 1234\n","\n","3.
